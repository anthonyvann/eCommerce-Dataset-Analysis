# Analysis of Consumer Electronics Purchase Trends on Amazon: A Data-Driven Approach

## Project Overview
In this project, an analysis will be performed on a dataset containing details of consumer electronics products on Amazon.
The focus will be on understanding consumer preferences, pricing trends, and reviewing behavior. This analysis will provide 
insights into market trends, customer sentiment, and pricing strategies.

## Key Components
**Technologies & Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Tableau**

**1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration using Python**
  - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, incorrect data types, etc.).
  - Conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the data's distribution and basic patterns.
    
**2. SQL for Data Manipulation & Analysis**
  - Write SQL queries to extract specific subsets of data, such as products with the highest discounts, most-rated products, or products with the most reviews.
  - Analyze trends over time, such as changes in average pricing or rating.
    
**3. Statistical Analysis**
  - Perform basic statistical analysis to understand the relationships between variables like price, rating, discount percentage, and review count.
  - Conduct sentiment analysis on review content to guage customer satisfaction.
    
**4. Data Visualization with Tableau**
  - Create interactive dashboards to visually represent the data analysis, such as price distributions, rating trends, and sentiment analysis results.
  - Develop visualizations that highlight key insights, such as top-rated products, categories with the highest discounts, or trends in customer reviews.
    
**5. Insights and Business Recommendations**
  - Interpret the data to draw meaningful insights about consumer behavior and market trends.
  - Provide recommendations for sellers on Amazon based on the analysis, such as pricing strategies, product improvement areas, or customer engagement tactics.


## Deliverables
  - A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing and EDA.
  - SQL scripts used for data extraction and analysis.
  - Tableau dashboards visualizing the key aspects of the analysis.
  - A final report or presentation summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
